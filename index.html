      <p> "A4 Revolution" is a censored topic in China right now. Because of the extremely strict zero-COVID policy,
        people lived in misery (such as starving, being forced into isolation, or even losing their lives). </p>
      <p>An apartment building fire occurred on November 24, 2022, in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, China. Ten individuals were killed
        and nine others were injured because the building's exits were closed in accordance with stringent COVID
        standards. Protests are sparked by this blaze in numerous major Chinese cities and among Chinese students and
        expatriates around the world.</p>
      <p> Countless Chinese young people are holding an A4-size white paper and protesting in the street. However, quite a
        number of them got arrested and have not been released yet. </p>
      <p> After changing the COVID regulation policy and opening the country, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) tries to
        cover up the history just like they did in 1989 at Tiananmen Square. However, I believe every citizen has the
        right to know about the whole story, so a comprehensive website about it would be helpful.

            <p>Rooster Statement by JIALUN TONG</p>
            <p>Artist's words: </p>
            <p>For over a billion people, our first introduction to the map of our home country was also a vivid analogy - a rooster. A symbol deep-seated in our minds that conjure polarizing feelings of recognition and belonging today. Paper, one of the Four Great Inventions of China, occurred in Western Han Dynasty - one would imagine to be used to further one’s expression, and pass down legacies longer and larger than life.</p>
            <p>Could our ancestors see how blank sheets of paper are being used today?</p>
            <p>As words unsaid echo around the world, the explicit loudness of blank paper reminds us of the fire that ignited this movement, and the fireball that cannot be censored from darkness.</p>              
            <p>A Chinese proverb reads, “Paper cannot keep the fire wrapped”. No one can stop the dawn from breaking, even with all the roosters muffled. No one can stop the birth of a new day. </p>

          <p>Over the past weekend, protests erupted in at least a dozen cities in China, sparked by anger over Covid
            restrictions. The protesters used various creative and subtle methods to communicate their frustration,
            including holding up blank sheets of white paper, which symbolized their voicelessness but also their power.
            The protests have been largely peaceful, but authorities have been trying to crack down on them. Despite
            attempts to censor the internet, photos and videos of the protests have gone viral outside of China, with
